**Week 2**
* Take notes as you work through the items below and submit them as your weekly report.  
* Verify the simulation results for the second order modulator shown in lecture 2. Replace the ideal integrators (in the analog part) with leaky integrators. Determine how much leakage ($\alpha$) can be tolerated before the peak quantization error doubles.
* Finish the tool installation and be sure to resolve any issues that you encountered last week.
* Create your first schematic and simulation as described here (of course, skip the installation step):

* For the above simulation example, go to Simulation-Edit Netlist in Xschem to inspect the circuit's netlist. Try to make sense of the format and look for "spice netlist syntax" on Google. You will need to understand the format and meaning of the various netlist elements for debugging. The Ngspice manual is another reference that you will need to consult frequently when setting up & debugging simulations.
* Inspect the idealized IDSM1 Xschem circuit discussed in lecture 3. Try to explain how the subtraction between the input and the feedback pulse is achieved. The charge conservation analysis presented in class may be useful for this (with a small modification).
* Enter your teaming details and project topic in the spreadsheet linked below (UH login required):

**Week 1**
* Take notes as you work through the items below and submit them as your weekly report. The report does not need to be pretty, but it should document what you have done, what worked/didn't, things you don't understand, etc. You can also suggest topics that should be covered in future lectures.
* Read the following papers about Columbia's course:  
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224621   
* Skim through the following paper, which describes the A/D converter that we'll use as our template project. You won't understand everything; we'll work things out in the coming weeks!  
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5641589
* Have a look at Raymond Yang and Yaqing Xia's Stanford EE 372 project at the link below. This will give you a feel for what your project deliverables will look like (GitHub repo, presentations, reports, etc.). Note that their circuit is also similar to our template project (albeit a little more complex).

* Think about your project topic. Do you have a specific idea or do you want to follow the template project?
* Network with your peers and join a team of 3-4 students. Of course, each team must work on the same project topic. The idea is to split the work and help each other toward delivering one common chip design per team.
* Begin installing the design tools on your computer. Follow the instructions under "Tools." No worries if you can't finish due to some issues; the idea is just to get started.
* If you will be working on the template project, read Section II.A of the following paper and try to replicate the results shown in Fig.1 using Scilab (or Simulink).
