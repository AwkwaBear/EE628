**Week 1**
* Take notes as you work through the items below and submit them as your weekly report. The report does not need to be pretty, but it should document what you have done, what worked/didn't, things you don't understand etc. You can also suggest topics that should be covered in future lectures.
* Read the following two papers:  
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10224621  
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9805608  
* Skim through the following paper, which describes the A/D converter that we'll use as our template project. You won't understand everything; we'll work things out in the coming weeks!

* Have a look at Raymond Yang and Yaqing Xia's Stanford EE 372 project at the link below. This will give you a feel for what your project deliverables will look like (GitHub repo, presentations, reports, etc.). Note that their circuit is also similar to our template project (albeit a little more complex).

* Think about your project topic. Do you have a specific idea or do you want to follow the template project?
* Network with your peers and join a team of 3-4 students. Of course, each team must work on the same project topic. The idea is to split the work and help each other toward delivering one common chip design per team.
